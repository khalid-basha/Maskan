# Maskan
Maskan is a real estate platform designed to provide a trusted user-friendly experience for buying and selling properties in the Palestinian market. Our goal is to address the limitations of previous attempts and offer comprehensive features that cater to the diverse needs of our users.

As a buyer on Maskan, you have access to a wide range of properties listed for sale. You can easily navigate through the available options using advanced search filters, including price, location, and number of rooms, among others. Our platform allows you to view 360 images, and read detailed property descriptions and features.

If you find a property that youâ€™re interested in, Maskan provides the convenience of scheduling a tour. You can arrange a visit to personally inspect the property and get a closer look. Additionally, our platform offers a built-in chatting system, allowing you to easily communicate with the property owner or seller, in addition to getting notified whenever needed such as a property you own has a new reserved visit.

Moreover, Maskan incorporates a machine learning system that provides price predictions based on the house features. This technology takes into account various factors such as property size, location, room number, and market trends to estimate the fair market value of a property. This feature assists buyers and sellers in considering the pricing of properties.

From an administrative perspective, Maskan ensures quality control by allowing administrators to review and manage seller requests. This way, we maintain the integrity and reliability of the listings displayed on our platform.

At Maskan, we are committed to serving as a comprehensive real estate solution in the Palestinian market. Our platform aims to address the gaps observed in previous initiatives by offering a range of features that align with the diverse needs of our users.
